 NOTE: 
 things you need to change for the project to work on your computer
 
 1.You need to create a database, i used PHPMyAdmin for this hence i attached a .mysql file which contains all the data.
 
 2.create a virtual environment and install all the packages in the requirement file.
 
 to improve the accuracy of the model you can use more of the dataset. i only used 6000 samples. the data is available  on the appen website(open source)
